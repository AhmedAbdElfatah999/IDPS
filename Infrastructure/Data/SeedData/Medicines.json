In the case of human tissue, it can kill and destroy cells upon contact. This is important when the cells you want to kill are cancerous.\nCryosurgery is typically used for tumors or precancerous lesions found on your skin.

A number of natural penicillins have been discovered, but only two purified compounds are in clinical use: penicillin G (intravenous use) and penicillin V (given by mouth). Penicillins were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci. They are members of the ?-lactam antibiotics, which are some of the most powerful and successful achievements in modern science.They are still widely used today for different bacterial infections, though many types of bacteria have developed resistance following extensive use.\n\nAbout 10% of people report that they are allergic to penicillin; however, up to 90% of this group may not actually be allergic. Serious allergies only occur in about 0.03%. Those who are allergic to penicillin are most often given cephalosporin C (another ?-lactam antibiotic) because there is only 10% crossover in allergy between the penicillins and cephalosporins.\n\nPenicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming as a crude extract of P. rubens.[4] Fleming's student Cecil George Paine was the first to successfully use penicillin to treat eye infection (ophthalmia neonatorum) in 1930. The purified compound (penicillin F) was isolated in 1940 by a research team led by Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain at the University of Oxford. Fleming first used the purified penicillin to treat streptococcal meningitis in 1942.[5] For the discovery, Fleming shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Florey and Chain.\n\nThere are several semi-synthetic penicillins which are effective against a broader spectrum of bacteria: these include the antistaphylococcal penicillins, aminopenicillins and the antipseudomonal penicillins.","DiseaseId":"19"},

It is also used to prevent malaria. Doxycycline can also be used in people who cannot be treated with penicillin to treat certain types of food poisoning. Doxycycline (Oracea) is used only to treat pimples and bumps caused by rosacea (a skin disease that causes redness, flushing, and pimples on the face). Doxycycline is in a class of medications called tetracycline antibiotics. It works to treat infections by preventing the growth and spread of bacteria. It works to treat acne by killing the bacteria that infects pores and decreasing a certain natural oily substance that causes acne. It works to treat rosacea by decreasing the inflammation that causes this condition.","DiseaseId":"13"},

Take a slow-acting capsule once a day.\n\nDosage:\nAdults: 75 to 150 mg per day, as a single dose or divided and distributed throughout the day.\n\nChildren: 1 - 3 mg per kg per day, in divided doses.","PictureUrl":"Diclofenac.jpg","Description":"Diclofenac, sold under the brand name Voltaren among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammatory diseases such as gout. It is taken by mouth, rectally in a suppository, used by injection, or applied to the skin. Improvements in pain last for as much as eight hours. It is also available in combination with misoprostol in an effort to decrease stomach problems.\n\nCommon side effects include abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, dizziness, headache, and swelling. Serious side effects may include heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and stomach ulceration. Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy. It is likely safe during breastfeeding. It is believed to work by decreasing the production of prostaglandin. It blocks both cycloxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2).\n\nDiclofenac was patented in 1965 by Ciba-Geigy; it came into medical use in the United States in 1988. It is available as a generic medication. In 2018, it was the 72nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 11 million prescriptions. It is available as both a sodium and a potassium salt.","DiseaseId":"14"},

This includes painful menstrual periods, migraines, and rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in a premature baby. It can be used by mouth or intravenously. It typically begins working within an hour.\n\nCommon side effects include heartburn and a rash. Compared to other NSAIDs, it may have other side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding. It increases the risk of heart failure, kidney failure, and liver failure. At low doses, it does not appear to increase the risk of heart attack; however, at higher doses it may. Ibuprofen can also worsen asthma. While it is unclear if it is safe in early pregnancy, it appears to be harmful in later pregnancy and therefore is not recommended. Like other NSAIDs, it works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins by decreasing the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Ibuprofen is a weaker anti-inflammatory agent than other NSAIDs.\n\nIbuprofen was discovered in 1961 by Stewart Adams at Boots UK Limited and initially marketed as Brufen. It is available under a number of trade names, including Nurofen, Advil and Motrin. It was first marketed in 1969 in the United Kingdom and in the United States in 1974. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2018, it was the 28th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 24 million prescriptions.","DiseaseId":"14"},

Probiotics are considered generally safe to consume, but may cause bacteria-host interactions and unwanted side effects in rare cases. There is little evidence that probiotics bring the health benefits claimed for them.\nThe first discovered probiotic was a certain strain of bacillus in Bulgarian yogurt, called Lactobacillus bulgaricus. The discovery was made in 1905 by Bulgarian physician and microbiologist Stamen Grigorov. The modern-day theory, is generally attributed to Nobel laureate �lie Metchnikoff, who postulated that yoghurt-consuming Bulgarian peasants lived longer.\nA growing probiotics market has led to the need for stricter requirements for scientific substantiation of putative benefits conferred by microorganisms claimed to be probiotic. Although numerous claimed benefits are marketed towards using consumer probiotic products, such as reducing gastrointestinal discomfort, improving immune health, relieving constipation, or avoiding the common cold, such claims are not supported by scientific evidence, and are prohibited as deceptive advertising in the United States by the Federal Trade Commission. As of 2019, numerous applications for approval of health claims by European manufacturers of probiotic dietary supplements have been rejected by the European Food Safety Authority for insufficient evidence of beneficial mechanism or efficacy.","DiseaseId":"15"}
